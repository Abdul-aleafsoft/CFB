            <h1>Cyber Flipbook is</h1>
                <p>Cyber Flipbook was inspired by the National Police Chiefs’ Council Cyber Crime Manual, and the subsequent Cyber Tools application developed by the Metropolitan Police in London. The mission of this application provides guidance to law enforcement personnel tackling cybercrimes.</p>
                <p>Effective early action is critical to maximize the opportunity for the identification, preservation, collection and subsequent examination of cybercrime evidence. Once collected, the critical stages of analysis and preservation of evidence and the attribution and accountability for the guilty are pursued.</p>
                <p>The app will cover the time in the investigation where the criminal conduct is being identified by the law enforcement officer or other individual(s) conducting intake of information through identification of evidence, collection, transport and selection of charges. </p>
                <p>An overarching goal of this project is to build the capacity of law enforcement agencies by assisting in the investigation of cybercrimes and criminals more accessible to law enforcement agencies globally. This app is not meant to replace or supplant a department or jurisdiction’s mandates or policies but simply act as a guide for officers in this area of investigation.</p>
            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>The Global Cyber Alliance (GCA) is an international, cross-sector effort dedicated to reducing cyber risk and improving our connected world. We achieve our mission by:

                Uniting Global Communities:
                We must stand as a global community, across sectors and geography, if we are to effectively address cyber risks.
                
                Implementing Concrete Solutions:
                We build concrete solutions that reduce cyber risk, and we make those solutions freely available for any organization or individual to use.
                
                Measuring the Effect:
                We believe in measuring effectiveness. We must measure to know we are doing the right things, and metrics drive action. We need to know what works and what does not.
